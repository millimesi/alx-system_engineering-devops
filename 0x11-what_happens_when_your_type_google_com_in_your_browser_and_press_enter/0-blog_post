**#What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter**
First of all let us assume you are connected to the internet network because the content of the domain google.com is not your local machine, it is somewhere on a server or in multiple servers. So typing https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter means finding those servers in the network establishing appropriate and secure connection and fetching the content. Based on the speed of the connection this process may happen with a fraction of a second. However it involves important steps and concepts. 
When you hit the enter button the browser initiates a **Domain Name System (DNS)** lookup to translate the human-readable domain name "www.google.com" into an **IP address**. Because the domain name is not the actual address of for the google servers it is the representation of the actual address which the IP address. IP addresses come in two main formats: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv4 addresses consist of four sets of numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.0.1), while IPv6 addresses use a longer hexadecimal format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334) to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet. DNS serves the browser by translating google.com to its IP address. With the IP in hand the browser tries to establish **TCP/IP** connection with the servers. TCP is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server using Internet Protocol (IP). TCP ensures reliable communication by breaking data into packets, sending them, and then reassembling them in the correct order at the destination. But before the connection establishes it may pass through a **firewall**, a security mechanism that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The firewall ensures that only authorized connections are permitted while blocking potentially harmful ones. After the connections is established the browser will send a request to access resources from the server. Here the important thing to notice is any exchange of data between the browser (client) and web server is done by **Hypertext Transfer Protocol/HTTP**. HTTP operates over TCP/IP, defining how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands. But to make this information exchange secure HTTP has an extension **HTTPs** that uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols to encrypt data transmitted between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. For large-scale websites like Google, incoming requests are often distributed across multiple servers to balance the load and improve performance. A **load balancer** sits between the client and the server farm, efficiently distributing incoming requests among the available servers based on various algorithms, such as round-robin or least connections. Once the request reaches the designated server, a **web server** software (e.g., Apache, Nginx) processes the request. It retrieves the requested web page or resource from its storage and prepares it for delivery back to the client. In more complex web applications, there may be an additional layer known as an **application server**. This server executes logic of the application, handling tasks such as user authentication, database access, and dynamic content generation. If the requested web page or resource relies on data stored in a **database** (which is often the case for dynamic websites), the application server queries the database to fetch the necessary information. The retrieved data is then combined with the rest of the web page content before being sent back to the client and it will be sent. Once the browser receives the web page information, it parses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It constructs the Document Object Model (DOM), calculates the layout, and renders the page. It fetches additional resources like images and handles user interactions. Finally, it caches resources for future visits, ensuring faster load times. The browser orchestrates a series of complex operations to transform the raw data received from the server into a visually appealing and interactive web page for the user to interact with. So from the initial DNS lookup to the final database query, every component works in harmony to fulfill your request and present the desired content on your screen. The intricate journey of the browser to serve a web pages seems like this.
